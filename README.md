# NBATeamPropPrediction

This project centers on the development of an NBA team total projection betting tool,
leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to predict NBA team scores and
provide betting recommendations. The tool aims to assist bettors in making informed
decisions by generating precise projections based on historical data. The report begins
with an overview of the project's motivation and objectives, emphasizing the challenges
faced by sports bettors and the advantages of using statistical models to gain an edge
over oddsmakers. It outlines the project's primary goals: developing an accurate
predictive model, offering actionable betting recommendations, and creating a
user-friendly web application.

The system architecture section details the top-level components of the project,
including the frontend (built with React), the backend (using Node.js and Express), the
database (MongoDB), and the predictive model (developed in Python). Each
component's role and interactions are described, highlighting the seamless integration
of the different parts of the system. The solution features section provides a detailed
tabulation of the product features, mapping them to their respective components and
functionalities.

Key features include intuitive user interfaces for selecting dates and viewing game
projections, CRUD operations for managing game data, predictive modeling for
generating team total projections, and performance tracking to continuously improve the
model.
